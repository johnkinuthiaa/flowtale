# FlowTale+

**FlowTale+** is an open-source, AI-powered interactive storytelling platform. It allows users to craft their own adventures where every choice carves a new path in an ever-evolving story, dynamically generated by Google's Gemini AI.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Narrative**: Leverages the Gemini API via Genkit to generate dynamic storylines, characters, and branching paths based on user prompts and choices.
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Users start with a topic and genre, and their decisions directly influence the direction of the narrative.
- **Dynamic Story Visualization**: A visual graph displays the story's branching paths, allowing users to revisit previous choices and explore different timelines.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components.
- **Local Persistence**: Stories are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing users to continue their adventures at any time.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)
- **UI**: [React](https://react.dev/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the UI, typically on `http://localhost:4000`.

5.  **Run the development server:**
